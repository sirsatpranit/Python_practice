Given a sorted array of integers A of size N and an integer B, 
where array A is rotated at some pivot unknown beforehand.

For example, the array [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7] might become [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2].

Your task is to search for the target value B in the array. If found, return its index; otherwise, return -1.

You can assume that no duplicates exist in the array.

NOTE: You are expected to solve this problem with a time complexity of O(log(N)).
